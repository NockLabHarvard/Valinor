Society of Probabilistic Graphical Models to Model, Understand and Predict Self Harm
We combine and exert the power of probabilistic graphical models, decision theoretic models, and Box's loop to better understand, intervene and predict self-injurious behavior on TalkLife, a large-scale online peer-support network. We imbue our models with the knowledge of current theoretical models in clinical psychology, choose model specifications that respect the sparsity, noise and complexity of the observed phenomena, and extensively critique our models with an aim of forging a better understanding of the risk-factors and behaviors underlying self-harm given large-scale behavioral data of thousands of individuals self-reporting engagement in self-harm. Our hope is to not only bettter understand their plight, but also eventually craft meaningful interventions that may help these individuals online.
